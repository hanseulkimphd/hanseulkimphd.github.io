I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow at the [Clinical and Translational Epidemiology Unit (CTEU)](https://www.mghcteu.org/) within Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School and [Huttenhower lab](https://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/home/) at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, where I am co-mentored by Drs. Long Nguyen, Andrew Chan, and Curtis Huttenhower. My research interests are primarily focused on investigating the gut microbial communities in relation to various gastrointestinal and hepatic conditions, with a particular emphasis on colorectal cancer and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease.

I obtained Ph.D. in Population Health Sciences, with a focus on epidemiology, from Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. My doctoral thesis explored the associations between vitamin D, calcium, and early-onset colorectal neoplasia.
